                Our company is committed to enabling opportunities for everyone, no matter the circumstances.
                
                We are aiming to provide a safe and convenient environment for those in need of it. Since our inception, we have been committed to making top quality products with a portable twist and promoted safety through a practical lens. <br />
                

                <br />Company History and Growth <br />
                Since our inception in 2022, we have been looking to make a product for the disabled. One of our members is motorly handicapped, which gave us valuable insight into these problems. We are a relatively small team of four, and are closely knit within the company.
                
                Although our company is focused on disability accessibility, we have also contacted and worked with members in organization Red Cross, in an effort to use our existing products in order to develop sturdy and sustainable bridges in response to environmental catastrophe. 
                
                So far, Hephaestus has been in the research and development stages. This has taken so long because we want to achieve a top notch product, a challenging endeavor indeed. We plan to come out with two products, a folding but extendable ramp for those with motor disabilities, and an emergency rescue extendable bridge. <br /> 
                

                <br />Organizational Structure <br />
                Hephaestus distinguishes itself through a small team run by a few people, which makes all operations quick and functional. But even so we have established a company structure, in hopes to expand in the future. 
                
                We are divided into three main departments: chief of technology, finance, and marketing, with Jacob Domingo, Ananya Iyer, and Sho Newman running them respectively. And we have our CEO, Noelle Yoo, overseeing all operations. This is a perfect model for scaling up, and we are fully prepared to take on a larger group.
                
                But we have accomplished much in our time as a small team. All departments are heavily integrated with each other, so production keeps all values in mind. <br /> 
                

                <br />Financial Statement <br />
                This year, i.e. 2022, we have carefully calculated a budget of 70,000, and an estimated income of 435,000. 
                
                The budget is comprehensive and was created through a meticulous and intense process of calculations, considering all possible factors to determine the financial requirements of the company. The budget covers a few main areas, including material costs for the ramp products, salaries, taxes, etc. 
                
                We are thankful to our several partners and sponsors for supporting Hephaestus, including Red Cross, Amazon, and the Pentagon. Their contributions have always - and continue to - provide revenue to make our ambitions a reality. <br> 
                
                Risk Analysis
                Our company recognizes the risks of our company. It is true we have not come out with any products yet, but we also acknowledge that when we are ready, our products will be some if not the best on the market. 
                
                First, lack of sustainability within our company and products will not allow us to create the best possible product and reduce our performance. Due to this risk, we have been able to develop a system which will negate these effects. Older workers or veterans will mentor any new recruits.
                
                We have two very specific target audiences, which both are a mostly untapped market, which we intend to revolutionize. <br />
                
                
                <br />Marketing <br />
                From the people to the logo we here at Hephaestus are looking to grow awareness of our product as we believe that it will greatly help many people. 
                
                We utilize the popular use of social media platforms to promote our product to become a recognizable brand. This not only grows the use of our product, it also raises awareness of struggles of disabled people to the younger audience. As we continue to grow, we reach out to many people online with recruitment platforms in pursuit of creating a large community of caring, helpful employees. 
                
                We also visit public showcase events where we spread awareness of our product and the issues our product will solve. We make sure that our message is clearly communicated to our audience with our PR team. 
                
                We recognize the importance of communicating our product to the public as this resource can be a life changing contraption. With our competent team of young inspired engineers, we partnered with Red Cross in an effort to create a new product and further grow our company. Our dedication to these products is in an effort to make the lives of disabled people better. <br />
                
                
                <br />Fundraising Strategy <br />
                We recognize that starting a company needs a solid plan. With this in mind, we plan to attract revenue by making advertisements towards our audience. We plan to reach out to similar organizations and partner with them to grow our company brand, as well as sponsorships and grants. We plan to get government grants from their increasing interest in our products, including our emergency extendable ramp. In addition, we plan to give back to the community via donations to nonprofit organizations. This can also raise awareness as well as our image in hopes of customers choosing our products instead of alternative products.
